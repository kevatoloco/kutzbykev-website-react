          <p>
            Orange County is my hometown, and I graduated in computer science
            from UCSD. I'm a friendly and laid-back person who loves making new
            connections. I've been honing my barbering skills for 6 years and
            counting. Beyond the chair, I enjoy gaming, basketball, dance, and
            coding. My barber journey began when I tried saving money for
            college by learning to cut my own hair from YouTube. Let's just say
            my first attempts were hilariously bad! Experimenting on friends and
            cousins, I discovered my talent for cutting hair. It's more than
            just haircuts – I find joy in boosting people's confidence to pursue
            their aspirations and listening to their unique stories.
