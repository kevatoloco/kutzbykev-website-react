          <p>
            I'm an Orange County native and UCSD computer science graduate. With
            6+ years of barbering experience, I'm a friendly, laid-back
            individual passionate about connections. Beyond the chair, I love
            gaming, basketball, dance, and coding. My barber journey started
            with self-haircut attempts for college savings, evolving from
            YouTube learning. From awkward beginnings on friends to discovering
            a talent, I find fulfillment in elevating confidence and hearing
            diverse stories beyond haircuts.
